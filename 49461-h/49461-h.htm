<p class="center smallfont">THE STAGE.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter the </i>Stage-keeper.</p>

<p><span class="name">Stage.</span> Gentlemen, have a little patience, they are e’en upon
coming, instantly. He that should begin the play, master Littlewit, the proctor, has a
stitch new fallen in his black silk stocking; ’twill be drawn up ere you can tell twenty:
he plays one o’ the Arches that dwells about the hospital, and he has a very pretty part.
But for the whole play, will you have the truth on’t?—I am looking, lest the poet hear me,
or his man, master Brome, behind the arras—it is like to be a very conceited scurvy one,
in plain English. When’t comes to the Fair once, you were e’en as good go to Virginia, for
any thing there is of Smithfield. He has not hit the humours, he does not know them; he
has not conversed with the Bartholomew birds, as they say; he has ne’er a sword and
buckler-man in his Fair; nor a little Davy, to take toll o’ the bawds there, as in my
time; nor a Kindheart, if any body’s teeth should chance to ache in his play; nor a
juggler with a well-educated ape, to come over the chain for a king of England, and back
again for the prince, and sit still on his arse for the pope and the king of Spain. None
of these fine sights! Nor has he the canvas-cut in the night, for a hobby-horse man to
creep into his she-neighbour, and take his leap there. Nothing! No: an some writer that I
know had had but the penning o’ this matter, he would have made you such a jig-a-jog in
the booths, you should have thought an earthquake had been in the Fair! But these master
poets, they will have their own absurd courses; they will be informed of nothing. He has
(sir reverence) kick’d me three or four times about the tiring-house, I thank him, for but
offering to put in with my experience. I’ll be judged by you, gentlemen, now, but for one
conceit of mine: would not a fine pomp upon the stage have done well, for a property now?
and a punk set under upon her head, with her stern upward, and have been soused by my
witty young masters o’ the Inns of Court? What think you of this for a show, now? he will
not hear o’ this! I am an ass! I! and yet I kept the stage in master Tarleton’s time, I
thank my stars. Ho! an that man had lived to have played in Bartholomew Fair, you should
have seen him have come in, and have been cozen’d in the cloth-quarter, so finely! and
Adams, the rogue, have leaped and capered upon him, and have dealt his vermin about, as
though they had cost him nothing! and then a substantial watch to have stolen in upon
them, and taken them away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is in the
stage-practice.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter the</i> Bookholder <i>with a</i> Scrivener.</p>

<p><span class="name">Book.</span> How now! what rare discourse are you fallen upon, ha?
have you found any familiars here, that you are so free! what’s the business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">Stage.</span> Nothing, but the understanding gentlemen o’ the ground
here ask’d my judgment.</p>

<p><span class="name">Book.</span> Your judgment, rascal! for what? sweeping the stage, or
gathering up the broken apples for the bears within? Away, rogue, it’s come to a fine
degree in these spectacles, when such a youth as you pretend to a judgment. [<i>Exit
Stage-keeper.</i>]—And yet he may, in the most of this matter, i’faith: for the author has
writ it just to his meridian, and the scale of the grounded judgments here, his
play-fellows in wit.—Gentlemen, [<i>comes forward</i>] not for want of a prologue, but by
way of a new one, I am sent out to you here, with a scrivener, and certain articles drawn
out in haste between our author and you; which if you please to hear, and as they appear
reasonable, to approve of; the play will follow presently.—Read, scribe; give me the
counterpane.</p>

<p><span class="name2">Scriv.</span> <i>Articles of agreement, indented, between the
spectators or hearers, at the Hope on the Bankside in the county of Surry, on the one
party; and the author of </i>Bartholomew Fair,<i> in the said place and county, on the
other party: the one and thirtieth day of </i>October, 1614,<i> and in the twelfth year of
the reign of our sovereign lord </i>J<span class="smallerfont">AMES</span>,<i> by the
grace of God, king of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith; and of Scotland
the seven and fortieth.</i></p>

<p>Imprimis. <i>It is covenanted and agreed, by and between the parties aforesaid, and the
said spectators and hearers, as well the curious and envious, as the favouring and
judicious, as also the grounded judgments and understandings, do for themselves severally
covenant and agree to remain in the places their money or friends have put them in, with
patience, for the space of two hours and an half, and somewhat more. In which time the
author promiseth to present them by us, with a new sufficient play, called </i>Bartholomew
Fair,<i> merry, and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none;
provided they have either the wit or the honesty to think well of themselves.</i></p>

<p class="italics">It is further agreed, that every person here have his or their
free-will of censure, to like or dislike at their own charge, the author having now
departed with his right: it shall be lawful for any man to judge his sixpen’worth, his
twelvepen’worth, so to his eighteen-pence, two shillings, half a crown, to the value of
his place; provided always his place get not above his wit. And if he pay for half a
dozen, he may censure for all them too, so that he will undertake that they shall be
silent. He shall put in for censures here, as they do for lots at the lottery: marry, if
he drop but six-pence at the door, and will censure a crown’s-worth, it is thought there
is no conscience or justice in that.</p>

<p><i>It is also agreed, that every man here exercise his own judgment, and not censure by
contagion, or upon trust, from another’s voice or face, that site by him, be he never so
first in the commission of wit; as also that he be fixed and settled in his censure that
what he approves or not approves to-day, he will do the same to-morrow; and if to-morrow,
the next day, and so the next week, if need be: and not to be brought about by any that
sits on the bench with him, though they indite and arraign plays daily. He that will
swear, </i>Jeronimo<i> or </i>Andronicus,<i> are the</i><span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-182">[Pg 182]</a></span> <i>best plays yet, shall, pass
unexcepted at here, as a man whose judgment shews it is constant, and hath stood still
these five and twenty or thirty years. Though it be an ignorance it is a virtuous and
staid ignorance; and next to truth, a confirmed error does well; such a one the author
knows where to find him.</i></p>

<p class="italics">It is further covenanted, concluded, and agreed, That how great soever
the expectation be, no person here is to expect more than he knows, or better ware than a
fair will afford: neither to look back to the sword and buckler age of Smithfield, but
content himself with the present. Instead of a little Davy to take toll o’ the bawds, the
author doth promise a strutting horse-courser, with a leer drunkard, two or three to
attend him, in as good equipage as you would wish. And then for Kindheart the
tooth-drawer, a fine oily pig-woman with her tapster, to bid you welcome, and a consort of
roarers for musick. A wise justice of peace meditant, instead of a juggler with an ape. A
civil cutpurse searchant. A sweet singer of new ballads allurant: and as fresh an
hypocrite, as ever was broached, rampant. If there be never a servant-monster in the fair,
who can help it, he says, nor a nest of antiques? he is loth to make nature afraid in his
plays, like those that beget tales, tempests, and such-like drolleries, to mix his head
with other men’s heels; let the concupiscence of jigs and dances reign as strong as it
will amongst you: yet if the puppets will please any body, they shall be intreated to come
in.</p>

<p><i>In consideration of which, it is finally agreed, by the aforesaid hearers and
spectators, That they neither in themselves conceal, nor suffer by them to be concealed,
any state-decypherer, or politic pick-lock of the scene so solemnly ridiculous, as to
search out, who was meant by the gingerbread-woman, who by the hobby-horse man, who by the
costard-monger, nay, who by their wares. Or that will pretend to affirm on his own
inspired ignorance, what Mirror of Magistrates is meant by the justice, what great lady by
the pig-woman, what concealed statesman by the seller of mouse-traps, and so of the rest.
But that such person, or persons, so found, be left discovered to the mercy of the author,
as a forfeiture to the stage, and your laughter aforesaid. As also such as shall so
desperately, or ambitiously play the fool by his place aforesaid, to challenge the author
of scurrility, because the language somewhere savours of Smithfield, the booth, and the
pigbroth, or of profaneness, because a madman cries, </i>God quit you,<i> or </i>bless
you!<i> In witness whereof, as you have preposterously put to your seals already, which is
your money, you will now add the other part of suffrage, your hands. The play shall
presently begin. And though the Fair be not kept in the same region that some here,
perhaps, would have it; yet think, that therein the author hath observed a special
decorum, the place being as dirty as Smithfield, and as stinking every whit.</i></p>

<p class="italics">Howsoever, he prays you to believe, his ware is still the same, else
you will make him justly suspect that he that is so loth to look on a baby or an
hobby-horse here, would be glad to take up a commodity of them, at any laughter or loss in
another place.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> A pretty conceit, and worth the finding! I have such
luck to spin out these fine things still, and, like a silk-worm, out of my self. Here’s
master Bartholomew Cokes, of Harrow o’ the Hill, in the county of Middlesex, esquire,
takes forth his license to marry mistress Grace Wellborn, of the said place and county:
and when does he take it forth? to-day! the four and twentieth of August! Bartholomew-day!
Bartholomew upon Bartholomew! there’s the device! who would have marked such a leap-frog
chance now! A very .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. less than ames-ace, on two dice! Well, go thy ways,
John Littlewit, proctor John Littlewit: one of the pretty wits of Paul’s, the Littlewit of
London, so thou art called, and something beside. When a quirk or a quiblin does ’scape
thee, and thou dost not watch and apprehend it, and bring it afore the constable of
conceit, (there now, I speak quib too,) let them carry thee out o’ the archdeacon’s court
into his kitchen, and make a Jack of thee, instead of a John. There I am again la!—</p>

<p class="no_indent">Win, good-morrow, Win; ay, marry, Win, now you look finely indeed,
Win! this cap does convince! You’d not have worn it, Win, nor have had it velvet, but a
rough country beaver, with a copper band, like the coney-skin woman of Budge-row; sweet
Win, let me kiss it! And her fine high shoes, like the Spanish lady! Good Win, go a
little, I would fain see thee pace, pretty Win; by this fine cap, I could never leave
kissing on’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Lit.</span> Come indeed la, you are such a fool still!</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> No, but half a one, Win, you are the t’other half: man
and wife make one fool, Win. Good! Is there the proctor, or doctor indeed, in the diocese,
that ever had the fortune to win him such a Win! There I am again! I do feel conceits
coming upon me, more than I am able to turn tongue to. A pox o’ these pretenders to wit!
your Three Cranes, Mitre and Mermaid men! not a corn of true salt, not a grain of right
mustard amongst them all. They may stand for places, or so, again the next wit-fall, and
pay two-pence in a quart more for their canary than other men. But give me the man can
start up a justice of wit out of six shillings beer, and give the law to all the poets and
poet-suckers in town:—because they are the player’s gossips! ’Slid! other men have wives
as fine as the players, and as well drest. Come hither, Win!</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Troth, I am a little taken with my Win’s dressing here:
does it not fine, master Winwife? How do you apprehend, sir? she would not have worn this
habit. I challenge all Cheapside to shew such another: Moorfields, Pimlico-path, or the
Exchange, in a summer evening, with a lace to boot, as this has. Dear Win, let master
Winwife kiss you. He comes a wooing to our mother, Win, and may be our father perhaps,
Win. There’s no harm in him, Win.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> None in the earth, master Littlewit.</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Kisses her.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> I envy no man my delicates, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> Alas, you have the garden where they grow still! A wife

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> But my taste, master Littlewit, tends to fruit of a
later kind; the sober matron, your wife’s mother.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Ay, we know you are a suitor, sir; Win and I both wish
you well: By this license here, would you had her, that your two names were as fast in it
as here are a couple! Win would fain have a fine young father-i’-law, with a feather; that
her mother might hood it and chain it with mistress Overdo. But you do not take the right
course, master Winwife.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> No, master Littlewit, why?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> You are not mad enough.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> How! is madness a right course?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> I say nothing, but I wink upon Win. You have a friend,
one master Quarlous, comes here sometimes.</p>

heart, Win.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Lit.</span> Sir, my mother has had her nativity-water cast
lately by the cunning-men in Cow-lane, and they have told her her fortune, and do ensure
her, she shall never have happy hour, unless she marry within this sen’night; and when it
is, it must be a madman, they say.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Ay, but it must be a gentleman madman.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Lit.</span> Yes, so the t’other man of Moorfields says.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> But does she believe them?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Yes, and has been at Bedlam twice since every day, to
inquire if any gentleman be there, or to come there mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> Why, this is a confederacy, a mere piece of practice
upon her by these impostors.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> I tell her so; or else, say I, that they mean some young
madcap gentleman; for the devil can equivocate as well as a shop keeper: and therefore
would I advise you to be a little madder than master Quarlous hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> Where is she, stirring yet?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Stirring! yes, and studying an old elder come from
Banbury, a suitor that puts in here at meal tide, to praise the painful brethren, or pray
that the sweet singers may be restored; says a grace as long as his breath lasts him! Some
time the spirit is so strong with him, it gets quite out of him, and then my mother, or
Win, are fain to fetch it again with malmsey or aqua cœlestis.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Lit.</span> Yes, indeed, we have such a tedious life with him
for his diet, and his clothes too! he breaks his buttons, and cracks seams at every saying
he sobs out.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> He cannot abide my vocation, he says.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Lit.</span> No; he told my mother, a proctor was a claw of the
beast, and that she had little less than committed abomination in marrying me so as she
has done.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Every line, he says, that a proctor writes, when it
comes to be read in the bishop’s court, is a long black hair, kemb’d out of the tail of

reach you after three hours’ running yet! What an unmerciful companion art thou, to quit
thy lodging at such ungentlemanly hours! none but a scattered covey of fidlers, or one of
these rag-rakers in dunghills, or some marrow-bone man at most, would have been up when
thou wert gone abroad, by all description. I pray thee what ailest thou, thou canst not
sleep? hast thou thorns in thy eye-lids, or thistles in thy bed?</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> I cannot tell: it seems you had neither in your feet,
that took this pain to find me.</p>

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> No, an I had, all the lime hounds o’ the city should
have drawn after you by the scent rather. Master John Littlewit! God save you, sir. ’Twas
a hot night with some of us, last night, John: shall we pluck a hair of the same wolf
to-day, proctor John?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Do you remember, master Quarlous, what we discoursed on
last night?</p>

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> Not I, John, nothing that I either discourse or do; at
those times I forfeit all to forgetfulness.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> No! not concerning Win? look you, there she is, and
drest, as I told you she should be: hark you, sir, [<i>whispers him.</i>] had you
forgot?</p>

John,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-186">[Pg 186]</a></span> when I
[am] drunk, an you have this dangerous memory: that’s certain.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Why, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> Why! we were all a little stained last night, sprinkled
with a cup or two, and I agreed with proctor John here, to come and do somewhat with Win
(I know not what ’twas) to-day; and he puts me in mind on’t now; he says he was coming to
fetch me. Before truth, if you have that fearful quality, John, to remember when you are
sober, John, what you promise drunk, John; I shall take heed of you, John. For this once I
am content to wink at you. Where’s your wife? come hither, Win.</p>

me, John.</p>

an outcry to your mother, Win! master Quarlous is an honest gentleman, and our worshipful
good friend, Win; and he is master Winwife’s friend too: and master Winwife comes a suitor
to your mother, Win; as I told you before, Win, and may perhaps be our father, Win:
they’ll do you no harm, Win; they are both our worshipful good friends. Master Quarlous!

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> Hoy-day! how respective you are become o’ the sudden? I
fear this family will turn you reformed too; pray you come about again. Because she is in
possibility to be your daughter-in-law, and may ask you blessing hereafter, when she
courts it to Totenham to eat cream! Well, I will forbear, sir; but i’faith, would thou
wouldst leave thy exercise of widow-hunting once; this drawing after an old reverend smock
by the splay-foot! There cannot be an ancient tripe or trillibub in the town, but thou art
straight nosing it, and ’tis a fine occupation thou’lt confine thyself to, when thou hast
got one; scrubbing a piece of buff, as if thou hadst the perpetuity of Pannier-ally to
stink in; or perhaps worse, currying a carcass that thou hast bound thyself to alive. I’ll
be sworn, some of them that thou art, or hast been suitor to, are so old, as no chaste or
married pleasure can ever become them; the honest instrument of procreation has forty
years since left to belong to them; thou must visit them as thou wouldst do a tomb, with a
torch or three handfuls of link, flaming hot, and so thou may’st hap to make them feel
thee and after come to inherit according to thy inches. A sweet course for a man to waste
the brand of life for, to be still raking himself a fortune in an old woman’s embers! We
shall have<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-187">[Pg 187]</a></span> thee,
after thou hast been but a month married to one of them, look like the quartan ague and
the black jaundice met in a face, and walk as if thou hadst borrow’d legs of a spinner,
and voice of a cricket. I would endure to hear fifteen sermons a week for her, and such
coarse and loud ones, as some of them must be! I would e’en desire of fate, I might dwell
in a drum, and take in my sustenance with an old broken tobacco-pipe and a straw. Dost
thou ever think to bring thine ears or stomach to the patience of a dry grace as long as
thy table-cloth; and droned out by thy son here (that might be thy father) till all the
meat on thy board has forgot it was that day in the kitchen? or to brook the noise made in
a question of predestination, by the good labourers and painful eaters assembled together,
put to them by the matron your spouse; who moderates with a cup of wine, ever and anon,
and a sentence out of Knox between? Or the perpetual spitting before and after a
sober-drawn exhortation of six hours, whose better part was the hum-ha-hum? or to hear
prayers, groaned out over thy iron chests, as if they were charms to break them? And all
this for the hope of two apostle-spoons, to suffer! and a cup to eat a caudle in! for that
will be thy legacy. She’ll have convey’d her state safe enough from thee, an she be a
right widow.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> Alas, I am quite off that scent now.</p>

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> How so?</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> Put off by a brother of Banbury, one that, they say, is

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> He was a baker, sir, but he does dream now, and see
visions; he has given over his trade.</p>

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> I remember that too; out of a scruple he took, that, in
spiced conscience, those cakes he made, were served to bridals, may-poles, morrices, and
such profane feasts and meetings. His christian-name is Zeal-of-the-land.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Yes, sir; Zeal-of-the-land Busy.</p>

<p><span class="name">Winw.</span> How! what a name’s there!</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> O they have all such names, sir; he was witness for Win
here,—they will not be call’d godfathers—and named her Win-the-fight: you thought her name
had been Winnifred, did you not?</p>

<p><span class="name">Quar.</span> Ay, for there was a blue-starch woman of the name at
the same time. A notable hypocritical vermin it is; I know him. One that stands upon his
face, more than his faith, at all times: ever in seditious motion, and reproving for
vainglory; of a most lunatic conscience and spleen, and affects the violence of
singularity in all he does: he has undone a grocer here, in Newgate-market, that broke
with him, trusted him with currants, as arrant a zeal as he, that’s by the way:—By his
profession he will ever be in the state of innocence though, and childhood; derides all
antiquity, defies any other learning than inspiration; and what discretion soever years
should afford him, it is all prevented in his original ignorance: have not to do with him,
for he is a fellow of a most arrogant and invincible dulness, I assure you.—Who is

run up and down the county with him to beg puddings and cake-bread of his tenants, and
almost spoil’d him; he has learn’d nothing but to sing catches, and repeat <i>Rattle
bladder, rattle!</i> and <i>O Madge!</i> I dare not let him walk alone, for fear of
learning of vile tunes, which he will sing at supper, and in the sermon-times! If he meet
but a carman in the street, and I find him not talk to keep him off on him, he will
whistle him and all his tunes over at night in his sleep! He has a head full of bees! I am
fain now, for this little time I am absent, to leave him in charge with a gentlewoman:
’tis true she is a justice of peace his wife, and a gentlewoman of the hood, and his
natural sister; but what may happen under a woman’s government, there’s the doubt.

<p><span class="name">Pure.</span> O brother Busy! your help here, to edify and raise us
up in a scruple: my daughter Win-the-fight is visited with a natural disease of women,
called a longing to eat pig.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Ay, sir, a Bartholomew pig; and in the Fair.</p>

<p><span class="name">Pure.</span> And I would be satisfied from you, religiously-wise,
whether a widow of the sanctified assembly, or a widow’s daughter, may commit the act
without offence to the weaker sisters.</p>

<p><span class="name">Busy.</span> Verily, for the disease of longing, it is a disease, a
carnal disease, or appetite, incident to women; and as it is carnal and incident, it is
natural, very natural: now pig, it is a meat, and a meat that is nourishing and may be
longed for, and so consequently eaten; it may be eaten; very exceeding well eaten; but in
the Fair, and as a Bartholomew pig, it cannot be eaten; for the very calling it a
Bartholomew pig, and to eat it so, is a spice of idolatry, and you make the Fair no better
than one of the high-places. This, I take it, is the state of the question: a
high-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

you see the danger my little wife is in, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">Pure.</span> Truly, I do love my child dearly, and I would not have
her miscarry, or hazard her firstfruits, if it might be otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="name">Busy.</span> Surely, it may be otherwise, but it is subject to
construction, subject, and hath a face of offence with the weak, a great face, a foul
face; but that face may have a veil put over it, and be shadowed as it were; it may be
eaten, and in the Fair, I take it, in a booth, the tents of the wicked: the place is not
much, not very much, we may be religious in the midst of the profane, so it be eaten with
a reformed mouth, with sobriety and humbleness; not gorged in with gluttony or greediness,
there’s the fear: for, should she go there, as taking pride in the place, or delight in
the unclean dressing, to feed the vanity of the eye, or lust of the palate, it were not
well, it were not fit, it were abominable, and not good.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Nay, I knew that afore, and told her on’t; but courage,
Win, we’ll be humble enough, we’ll seek out the homeliest booth in the Fair, that’s
certain; rather than fail, we’ll eat it on the ground.</p>

distance, in disguise.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">Over.</span> Well, in justice name, and the king’s, and for the
commonwealth! defy all the world, Adam Overdo, for a disguise, and all story; for thou
hast fitted thyself, I swear. Fain would I meet the Linceus now, that eagle’s eye, that
piercing Epidaurian serpent (as my Quintus Horace calls him) that could discover a justice
of peace (and lately of the Quorum) under this covering. They may have seen many a fool in
the habit of a justice; but never till now, a justice in the habit of a fool. Thus must we
do though, that wake for the public good; and thus hath the wise magistrate done in all
ages. There is a doing of right out of wrong, if the way be found. Never shall I enough
commend a worthy worshipful man, sometime a capital member of this city, for his high
wisdom in this point, who would take you now the habit of a porter, now of a carman, now
of the dog-killer, in this month of August; and in the winter, of a seller of
tinder-boxes. And what would he do in all these shapes? marry, go you into every alehouse,
and down into every cellar; measure the length of puddings; take the gage of black pots
and cans, ay, and custards, with a stick; and their circumference with a thread; weigh the
loaves of bread on his middle finger; then would he send for them home; give the puddings
to the poor, the bread to the hungry, the custards to his children; break the pots, and
burn the cans himself: he would not trust his corrupt officers, he would do it himself.
Would all men in authority would follow this worthy precedent! for alas, as we are public
persons, what do we know? nay, what can we know? we hear with other men’s ears, we see
with other men’s eyes. A foolish constable or a sleepy watchman, is all our information;
he slanders a gentleman by the virtue of his place, as he calls it, and we, by the vice of
ours, must believe him. As, a while agone, they made me, yea me, to mistake an honest
zealous pursuivant for a seminary; and a proper young bachelor of musick, for a bawd. This
we are subject to that live in high place; all our intelligence is idle, and most of our
intelligencers knaves; and, by your leave, ourselves thought little better, if not arrant
fools, for believing them. I, Adam Overdo, am resolved therefore to spare spy-money
hereafter, and make mine own discoveries. Many are the yearly enormities of this Fair, in
whose courts of Pie-poudres I have had the honour, during the three days, sometimes to sit
as judge. But this is the<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-197">[Pg

book for the purpose; this the cloud that hides me; under this covert I shall see and not

<p class="no_indent">Look, here’s the poor fool again, that was stung by the Waspe
erewhile.</p>

<p><span class="name">Over.</span> I will make no more orations, shall draw on these
tragical conclusions. And I begin now to think, that by a spice of collateral justice,
Adam Overdo deserved this beating; for I, the said Adam, was one cause (a by-cause) why
the purse was lost; and my wife’s brother’s purse too, which they know not of yet. But I
shall make very good mirth with it at supper, that will be the sport, and put my little
friend, master Humphrey Waspe’s choler quite out of countenance: when, sitting at the
upper end of my table, as I use, and drinking to my brother Cokes, and mistress Alice
Overdo, as I will, my wife, for their good affection to old Bradley, I deliver to them, it
was I that was cudgeled, and shew them the marks. To see what bad events may peep out o’
the tail of good purposes! the care I had of that civil young man I took fancy to this
morning, (and have not left it yet,) drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company
indeed; which drew the cut-purse; which drew the money; which drew my brother Cokes his
loss; which drew on<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-214">[Pg
214]</a></span> Waspe’s anger; which drew on my beating: a pretty gradation! and they
shall have it in their dish, i’faith, at night for fruit; I love to be merry at my table.
I had thought once, at one special blow he gave me, to have revealed myself; but then (I
thank thee, fortitude) I remembered that a wise man, and who is ever so great a part of
the commonwealth in himself, for no particular disaster ought to abandon a public good
design. The husbandman ought not, for one unthankful year, to forsake the plough; the
shepherd ought not, for one scabbed sheep, to throw by his tar-box; the pilot ought not,
for one leak in the poop, to quit the helm; nor the alderman ought not, for one custard
more at a meal, to give up his cloke; the constable ought not to break his staff, and
forswear the watch, for one roaring night; nor the piper of the parish, <i>ut parvis
componere magna solebam</i>, to put up his pipes for one rainy Sunday. These are certain
knocking conclusions; out of which, I am resolved, come what come can, come beating, come
imprisonment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come the hurdle, (welcome
all,) I will not discover who I am, till my due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I
said ever, in justice name, and the king’s, and for the commonwealth.</p>

thousand pound, my love to you is become my rack; I’ll tell you all and the truth, since
you hate the hypocrisy of the party-coloured brotherhood. These seven years I have been a
wilful holy widow, only to draw feasts and gifts from my entangled suitors: I am also by
office an assisting sister of the deacons, and a devourer, instead of a distributor of the
alms. I am a special maker of marriages for our decayed brethren with our rich widows, for
a third part of their wealth, when they are married, for the relief of the poor elect: as
also our poor handsome young virgins, with our wealthy bachelors or widowers; to make them
steal from their<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
husbands, when I have confirmed them in the faith, and got all put into their custodies.
And if I have not my bargain, they may sooner turn a scolding drab into a silent minister,
than make me leave pronouncing reprobation and damnation unto them. Our elder,
Zeal-of-the-land, would have had me, but I know him to be the capital knave of the land,
making himself rich, by being made a feoffee in trust to deceased brethren, and cozening
their heirs, by swearing the absolute gift of their inheritance. And thus having eased my
conscience, and utter’d my heart with the tongue of my love; enjoy all my deceits
together, I beseech you. I should not have revealed this to you, but that in time I think
you are mad, and I hope you’ll think me so too, sir?</p>

trade too that she has beside, ha? The t’other wench Winwife is sure of; there’s no
expectation for me there. Here I may make myself some saver yet, if she continue mad,
there’s the question. It is money that I want, why should not I marry the money when ’tis
offer’d me? I have a license and all, it is but razing out one name, and putting in
another. There’s no playing with a man’s fortune! I am resolved: I were truly mad an I

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> No! not now my hat is off? what would you have done

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> What! do they live in baskets?</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> They do lie in a basket, sir, they are o’ the small
players.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> These be players minors indeed. Do you call these
players?</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> They are actors, sir, and as good as any, none
dispraised, for dumb shows: indeed, I am the mouth of them all.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> Thy mouth will hold them all. I think one tailor would
go near to beat all this company with a hand bound behind him.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Ay, and eat them all too, an they were in
cake-bread.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> I thank you for that, master Littlewit; a good jest!
Which is your Burbage now?</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> What mean you by that, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> Your best actor, your Field?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> Good, i’faith! you are even with me, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> This is he, that acts young Leander, sir: he is
extremely beloved of the womenkind, they do so affect his action, the green gamesters,
that come here! and this is lovely Hero: this with the beard, Damon; and this pretty
Pythias: this is the ghost of king Dionysius in the habit of a scrivener; as you shall see
anon at large.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> Well, they are a civil company, I like ’em for that;
they offer not to fleer, nor jeer, nor break jests, as the great players do: and then,
there goes not so much charge to the feasting of them, or making them drunk, as to the
other, by reason of their littleness. Do they use to play perfect? are they never
fluster’d?</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> No, sir, I thank my industry and policy for it; they
are as well govern’d a company, though I say it——And here is young Leander, is as proper
an actor of his inches, and shakes his head like an hostler.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> But do you play it according to the printed book? I
have read that.</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> By no means, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> No! how then?</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> A better way, sir; that is too learned and poetical
for our audience: what do they know what <i>Hellespont</i> is, <i>guilty of true love’s
blood?</i> or what <i>Abydos</i> is? or <i>the other, Sestos hight?</i></p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> Thou art in the right; I do not know myself.</p>

<p><span class="name">Leath.</span> No, I have entreated master Littlewit to take a little
pains to reduce it to a more familiar strain for our people.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> How, I pray thee, good master Littlewit?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lit.</span> It pleases him to make a matter of it, sir; but there is
no such matter, I assure you: I have only made it a little easy, and modern for the times,
sir, that’s all. As for the Hellespont, I imagine our Thames here; and then Leander I make
a dyer’s son about Puddle-wharf: and Hero a wench o’ the Bank-side, who going over one
morning to Old Fish-street, Leander spies her land at Trig-stairs, and falls in love with
her. Now do I introduce Cupid, having metamorphosed himself into a drawer, and he strikes
Hero in love with a pint of sherry; and other pretty passages there<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-251">[Pg 251]</a></span> are of the
friendship, that will delight you, sir, and please you of judgment.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cokes.</span> I’ll be sworn they shall: I am in love with the actors
already, and I’ll be allied to them presently.—They respect gentlemen, these fellows:—Hero
shall be my fairing: but which of my fairings?—let me see—i’faith, my fiddle; and Leander
my fiddlestick: then Damon my drum, and Pythias my pipe, and the ghost of Dionysius my
hobby-horse. All fitted.</p>

Cokes’ things, and helped you to your beating and the stocks; if you have a mind to hang

edition of Jonson’s plays which was first published in 1910 by J.M. Dent in London. Images

<p>Any transcription of a 1910 edition of a Jacobean text will run into some minor
problems, and “Bartholomew Fair” poses its own special set of challenges. The goal of the
Everyman’s Library edition was to create a readable text, but editorial standards have
changed since it was first published. Certain words from the Folio were censored. For
example, “t—” is substituted for “turd”. The Everyman’s Library edition frequently spells
out words that are contractions in the Folio, for example, substituting <i>in</i> for
<i>i’</i> and <i>have</i> for <i>ha’</i>. The Folio includes many stage directions, but
there are inconsistencies, errors, and apparent omissions. As a corrective, the editor of
the 1910 edition added more stage directions than more recent editors would. In the Folio,
stage directions are printed in the margins to indicate that the action happens during the
dialogue, and some lines are printed to the right of others to indicate simultaneous
dialogue, for example, during Nightingale’s song in Act III. The 1910 edition prints the
text without columns or margins. Consequently some stage directions were changed, and the
dialogue is printed sequentially, making it harder for the reader to get a sense of the
stage action.</p>

<p>In general, this transcription retains the text of the Everyman’s Library edition.
Censored words have been restored, and a few errors have been corrected. Inconsistencies
in the character titles have been corrected, and character names in stage directions have
been spelled out. Following the Folio’s conventions, the 1910 text italicizes text to set
off songs or lines from the play within a play, though somewhat inconsistently. This use
of italics has been made consistent. In the 1910 text, character titles preceding dialogue
in a regular typeface are italicized, and character titles preceding the italicized text
of songs or the play within the play are printed in a regular typeface. The html-based
files of this transcription retain this use of contrasting regular and italicized
typefaces. In the text version of this transcription, all character titles preceding
dialogue and in stage directions for entrances are capitalized. The character titles of
the puppets in Act V have been adjusted to help clarify which lines are part of the play
within a play.</p>

<p>The following changes to the Everyman’s Library text are noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover: The cover has been edited from the original dust jacket.</li>

<li>Title page: The 1910 text, which is part of an anthology of Jonson’s plays, only has a
title page for the collection. The text included in the title page for this etext is based
on the text of the Folio’s title page.</li>

<li>p. 189: <span class="name">Waspe.</span> Good master Hornet, t—in your teeth—Changed
“t—in” to “turd in” as in the Folio.</li>

<li>p. 189: and t—in your little wife’s teeth too—Changed “t—in” to “turd in”.</li>

<li>p. 190: <span class="name">Waspe.</span> Marry gip, goody She-justice, mistress
Frenchhood! t—in your teeth, and t—in your Frenchhood’s teeth too—Changed “t—in” to “turd
in”.</li>

<li>p. 191: <span class="name">Mrs. Lit.</span> And I am, for the cosset his
charge—Assigned this line to Winwife in keeping with the Folio.</li>

<li>p. 192: <span class="name">Over.</span> You will not let him go, brother, and lose
him?—For consistency, changed the character title “<span class="name">Over.</span>” to
“<span class="name">Mrs. Over.</span>”</li>

<li>p. 193: <span class="name">Gra.</span> Truly, I have no such fancy to the Fair—For
consistency, changed the character title “<span class="name">Gra.</span>” to “<span
class="name">Grace.</span>”</li>

<li>p. 195: For consistency with the rest of the text, changed the character title “<span
class="name">Bus.</span>” to “<span class="name">Busy.</span>”</li>

<li>p. 197: The text of the song beginning with the line “Now the Fair’s a filling!” has
been italicized in keeping with the Folio and the convention elsewhere in the text of
italicizing songs.</li>

<li>p. 198-99: and a quarter of pound of colt’s-foot mixt with it too, to [eke] it
out.—The Everyman’s Library edition substituted “[eke]” for “itch” in the Folio. The
original word has been restored.</li>

<li>p. 206: because he is an ass. and may be a-kin to the Cokeses?—Changed period after
“ass” to a comma.</li>

<li>p. 209: [<i>Beats Overdo.</i>—Changed the stage direction to “[<i>They speak all
together; and Waspe beats Overdo.</i>” based on the stage direction in the Folio and
deleted a second stage direction (“[<i>Beats Overdo again.</i>”), which is not in the
Folio. In the Folio, the dialogue is printed in two columns, with Cokes’, Mrs. Overdo’s,
and most of Waspe’s lines in one column, and Justice Overdo’s line in the other. The stage
direction is printed in the right margin.</li>

<li>p. 209: <i>Enter</i> V<span class="smallerfont">AL</span>, W<span
class="smallerfont">HIT</span>, H<span class="smallerfont">AGGISE</span>, <i>and</i>
B<span class="smallerfont">RISTLE</span>.—Deleted “V<span class="smallerfont">AL</span>”
from the list of characters entering. In the Folio, Jonson usually lists at the beginning
of a scene who is to speak in that scene and often uses these lists to indicate an
entrance. This character was not listed at the beginning of this scene in the Folio and
has no lines.</li>

<li>p. 210: <span class="name">Had.</span> Why, should the watch go by the clock—Corrected
the character title abbreviation to “<span class="name">Hag.</span>” in keeping with the
Folio.</li>

<li>p. 214: in justice name, and the king’s, and for the commonwealth.—Inserted
“[<i>Exit.</i>” at the end of Overdo’s speech. On p. 217, a stage direction indicates that
Overdo re-enters, but the Everyman’s Library edition does not indicate his exit after his
speech. The Folio implies his exit before Cokes, Mistress Overdo, and Grace enter.</li>

<li>p. 215: nay, you have it, sir, an you be angry, t—in your teeth, twice;—Changed “t—in”
to “turd in”.</li>

<li>p. 218: Look you, sister, here, here, [<i>he shews his purse boastingly</i>], let him
come—Deleted the comma after the second “here” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 218: <span class="name2">Cokes.</span> <i>So I heard them say!</i>—In keeping with
the Folio, the text “So I heard them say!” is not italicized, and consequently the
character title “Cokes” is italicized in the html-based files.</li>

<li>p. 223: <span class="name">Winw.</span> I’ll look to you, in faith,
gamester.—[<i>Aside.</i>] An unfortunate foolish tribe—Reversed the order of the em dash
and the stage direction to clarify that the first sentence is an aside.</li>

<li>p. 224: <i>Enter</i> Mrs. P<span class="smallerfont">URECRAFT</span>.—Changed “Mrs.”
to “Dame” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 228: <i>Enter</i> P<span class="smallerfont">OCHER</span>, <i>and</i>
Officers <i>with</i> B<span class="smallerfont">USY</span>, <i>followed by</i> Mrs. P<span
class="smallerfont">URECRAFT</span>.—Changed “Mrs.” to “Dame” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 234: After Knockem’s line “To what do you say nay, sir?”, inserted the stage
direction from the Folio describing the game of vapors.</li>

<li>p. 236: <span class="name">Waspe.</span> A t— in your teeth, never pre dee me, for I
will have nothing mistaken.—Changed “t—” to “turd”.</li>

<li>p. 236: <span class="name">Knock.</span> T—! ha, t—? a noisome vapour: strike,
Whit.—Changed “T—” and “t—” to spell the word “turd.”</li>

<li>p. 237: marry s— o’ your hood—Changed “s—” to “shite” using the spelling in the
Folio.</li>

<li>p. 237: t— in your teeth for a fee, now.—Changed “t—” to “turd”.</li>

<li>pp. 253-60: In keeping with the Folio, the character titles of the puppets
have been changed so that “Pup.” precedes the abbreviated name. For example, “Lean.”
(short for “Leander”) has been changed to “Pup. Lean.”</li>

<li>p. 254: <span class="name2">Leath.</span> <i>How, Hogrubber of Pickthatch.</i>—In
keeping with the Folio, changed the period at the end of the sentence to a question
mark.</li>

<li>p. 257: Italicized Leatherhead’s speech beginning “How, some wine there!” for
consistency in italicizing text that is part of the puppet show.</li>

<li>p. 257: <span class="name2">Pup. Hero.</span> <i>Kiss the whore o’ the a—.</i>—Changed
“<i>a—</i>” to “<i>arse</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 257: <i>You must kiss her o’ the a—, she says.</i>—Changed “<i>a—</i>” to
“<i>arse</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 260: you also, young man [<i>to Edgeworth</i>] shall be my care; stand
there.—Changed “<i>Edgeworth</i>” to “<i>Edgworth</i>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 261: witness this easy and honest young man, [<i>pointing to Edge</i>]—[<i>to
Knock.</i>] Now, thou esquire of dames—Changed “<i>Edge</i>” to “<i>Edgworth.</i>” and
“<i>Knock</i>” to “<i>Knockem</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 261: <i>redde te Harpocratem.</i>—Capitalized the “<i>r</i>” in “<i>redde</i>” and
changed the period to an exclamation mark in keeping with the Folio. Overdo is pompously
ordering Littlewit to be quiet. An English translation is: “Turn yourself into
Harpocrates!” (i.e., the god of silence).</li>
